# Submission_reminder_app_CodeAlvinCreator
A shell-based tool designed to help manage and track students assignment submission efficiently via the command line. 

# Project Overview 
This project is organized into a set of bash scripts that works in hand to set up,pdate and run a submission reminder system. It is fully portable,uses relative paths and dynamically creates it's required files and environment at runtime. 

# Application Components
create_environment.sh: This script sets up the entire environment for the submission reminder tool:
	•	Prompts for the user’s name.
	•	Creates a custom directory named submission_reminder_{YourName}.
	•	Dynamically generates all required files and configurations inside this directory.
	•	Automatically creates a startup.sh script to initialize the reminder system.
copilot_shell_script.sh: A utility script for updating assignment details:
	•	Prompts the user to enter a new assignment title (e.g., Git Basics, Shell Navigation).
	•	Updates the config.env file within your reminder directory with the new assignment name.
	•	Re-launches the submission reminder app by executing startup.sh.
 startup.sh: This script is auto-generated by create_environment.sh:
	•	Acts as the main entry point for running the submission reminder system.
	•	Reads configuration data and displays assignment reminders to the user.
